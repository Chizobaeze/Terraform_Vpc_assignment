# AWS VPC ASSIGNMENT USING TERRAFORM



# BACKGROUND STORY
As a aspiring Data engineer,my menthor gave a task to use terraform to create an infrastructure for  vpc(virtual private cloud) on aws. the assignment wasn’t just about infrastructure — it was about understanding how modern data systems are built from the ground up. My goal was to create a secure, scalable environment that mimicked a real-world cloud setup. Using Terraform, I defined infrastructure as code, with cidr block, a public subnet, private subnet, routes, internet gateway and a dedicated security group. the setup ensured that public services had internet access, while private components remained protected.
